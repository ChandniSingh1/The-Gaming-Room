Having a base to work my project though with each update was very helpful. I could see my changes in my opinion ect.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would definitely be my responsive towards what the professor was looking for so I could get a higher grade.

I looked that their design restrictions and requirements and did a lot of research to come up with my answers.
